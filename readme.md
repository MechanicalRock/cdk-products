#CDK flow:
- Create a typescript project
- Create an App (extends cdk.App)
- Create one or more stacks(children of App in CDK terms)
- Each stack can have multiple resources like S3 bucket etc.
- To get a list of stacks:
    - `cdk ls -l`
- To generate CFN template, use CDK toolkit command
    - `cdk synth <stackName>`
        - You’ll see the template as the output in terminal
- To deploy your CDK app:
    - `cdk deploy`
        - This command invokes calls to Cloud formation service and creates/updates stacks using the default credentials & region in your machine
        - Couldn’t see the template getting uploaded in an S3 bucket
- To assume a role from the Sandbox account:
    - We need to set some AWS environment variables to force CDK to use these env vars instead of the default profile from `~/.aws/credentials` or `~/.aws/config`
    - Execute the following:
        - `./assume-role.sh`
            - You'll get most of the values required
        - Update `export-vars.sh` file with the new values
        - Source the `export-vars` script:
            - `source ./export-vars.sh`
                - All the required env vars should have been exported
    - Now, all cdk commands would use the temporary credentials exported as env vars
    - Execute cdk commands as you would normally.  
- The scripts require a bit of manual work to copy values and paste them in `export-vars.sh`. Needs to be worked on so that we can source the `assume-role.sh` script and export the vars directly.
